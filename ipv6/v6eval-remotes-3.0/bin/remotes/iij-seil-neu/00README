NOTE:
ipsecSetS{A,P}D.rmt, ipsecClearAll.rmt, clearnc.rmt and ping6.rmt are including
**UN-OFFICIAL COMMANDS**.
The ping6.rmt can't be changed to use an official command.
The "ping6" official command of SEIL has only one argument,
"hostname (destination)".
But our tool needs changing number of packets, data size, hoplimit and payload
data.

TODO:
ipsecClearAll.rmt
	- change to use "ipsec security-policy delete all" and 
	  "ipsec security-association delete all"
ipsecSetSAD.rmt
	- change to use "ipsec security-association ..."
ipsecSetSPD.rmt
	- change to use "ipsec security-policy ..."
clearnc.rmt
	- change to use "clear ndp-cache" (need confirm)
