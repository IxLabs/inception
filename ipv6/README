		v6eval-env


	Prerequisites

	* screen, start-stop-daemon, kvm
	* cu(uucp), socat
	* BSD pmake (included in home/bin)
	* v6eval installation
	* TAHI conformance tests(ct): SelfTest
	* ssh

This script creates a virtual environment for testing the IPv6 stack of the
Linux kernel using v6eval from the TAHI project[1].

Two virtual machines are created and connected according to this topology:

        192.168.33.1
    tap0----br0----tap2
     |              |
     |              |   
    eth0           eth0
    VM1            VM2
    eth1           eth1
     |              |
     |              |
    tap1----br1----tap3
       192.168.34.1


There is also a serial link between the machines used for remote management.
Initially, v6eval uses plain remote logins over the serial line, but I
couldn't make it work so I changed the remote implementation to work over ssh.
Over the serial link the VMs run SLIP with IPs 192.168.2.{1,2}. 
The account used on VM2 is root:root.


In the v6eval topology, VM1 is TN (Tester Node) and VM2 is the NUT (Network
Under Test).


	Getting v6eval to build on Linux

* Get v6eval-3.3.2.tar.gz from [1] and extract
* Get patch from [2]
* Install pmake (BSD make). Included in home/bin
* pmake && pmake install
* Files will be installed in /usr/local/v6eval
* Copy v6eval-configs/*.def to /usr/local/v6eval/etc
  Use tn-router.def and nut-router.def for testing VM2
  as a router. Rename them to tn.def and nut.def.

* Install patched v6eval-remotes
  # cd v6eval-remotes-3.0
  # pmake && pmake install

* Get the self test suite from [3]
* Extract the tests in the "home" directory
* Run the tests in VM1:
    # cd Self_Test_5-0-0/
    # pmake ipv6ready_p1_host     #Phase 1 host tests
    # pmake ipv6ready_p2_host     #Phase 2 host test

    If you need to test the routing functionality, use:
    # pmake ipv6ready_p1_router
    # pmake ipv6ready_p2_router

* Or, one test at a time, manually:
    # cd Self_Test_5-0-0/nd.p2
    # ./V6LC_2_1_1_A.seq -pkt V6LC_2_1_1_A.def
