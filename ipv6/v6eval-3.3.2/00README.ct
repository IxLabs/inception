Project Overview
================

TAHI Project is the joint effort formed with the objective of
developing and providing the verification technology for IPv6. 

The growth process of IPv4 was the history of encountering various kinds of
obstacles and conquering such obstacles. However, once the position as
infrastructure was established, it is not allowed to repeat the same history.
This is a reason why the verification technology is essential for IPv6
deployment.

	We research and develop conformance tests and interoperability tests
	for IPv6.

	We closely work with the KAME project and USAGI project.
	We help activities of these projects in the quality side by offering
	the verification technology we develop in TAHI project and improve
	the development efficiency. 

	We open the results and fruits of the project to the public for FREE.
	Any developer concerned with IPv6 can utilize the results and fruits
	of TAHI project freely. A free software plays an important role
	in progress of the Internet. We believe that providing the
	verification technology for FREE contributes to advances of IPv6.
	Besides the programs, the specifications and criteria of verification
	will be included in the Package.


Organizations
=============

TAHI Project started at October 1, 1998,
then the project was formed by following three organizations
(in alphabetical order):

	The University of Tokyo
	YDC Corp.
	Yokogawa Electric Corp.

Now the project is formed by following two organizations.

	The University of Tokyo
	Yokogawa Electric Corp.


Introduction of the Package
===========================

"ct" is the IPv6 Conformance Test Program Package written by TAHI project.
Not all IPv6 conformance tests developed referring to IPv6 related RFCs are
included in this Package.

The tests run on the IPv6 Conformance Test Tool Package "v6eval", 
that is also written by TAHI project. See 00README.v6eval for more
information about the Tool.

Both packages "ct" and "v6eval" may be obtained at our site:
	http://www.tahi.org/
