2001/10/19 Release 1.3
	Official release

2001/10/16 by toba
	Update tests: spec
		- Add judge pattern for 'HopLimit 1 to Router' test.
		  HopLimit in data area in ICMP error packet is 0 or 1.

	New tests:
		IPsec UDP test is added.
		- IPv4 only.
		- Host only.

2001/10/11 by hoshino
	Update tests: stateless-addrconf
		- DAD checking tests on Manual Address Configuration
		  were refined, then timing critical problem had been
		  solved. (Using vRemoteAsync(), vRemoteAsyncWait())
		- The test was removed and replaced by the new test.
		  removed: "Check if ValidLifetime is NOT reset on NUT by RA
		            with same prefix (before expiry, same VLT) "
		  new    : "Check if ValidLifetime is reset on NUT by RA
		            with same prefix (before expiry, same VLT) "
		- The test "DAD is performed on NUT by Stateless Global
		  address autoconfiguration" results changed from FAIL
		  to WARN if DAD NS didn't come on Global address auto-
		  configuration and link-local DAD didn't duplicate in
		  initialization phase, because RFC2462 says that an
		  implementation MAY choose to skip DAD for additional
		  addresses derived from the same interface identifier.

2001/10/11 by akisada
	Update tests: natpt
		contributed by Ericsson Telebit

2001/10/04 by akisada
	New tests:

2000/12/01 Release 1.2
	Official release

	Delete test:
		The following test is not coformity with RFC, so it's skipped over.
