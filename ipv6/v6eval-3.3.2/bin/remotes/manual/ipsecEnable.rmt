=head1 NAME

ipsecEnable.rmt - Enable and start IPsec function

=head1 SYNOPSIS

ipsecEnable.rmt [-commonoption ...]


=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<ipsecEnable.rmt> Enable and start IPsec function.
IPsec function is configured by ipsecSetSAD.rmt and ipsecSetSPD.rmt,
before executing ipsecEnable.rmt.

Do ``perldoc V6evalRemote'' for common options.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

The B<ipsecEnable.rmt> exits with one of the following values:

 0  command completed successfully
 1  command failed

=head1 NOTES

Some implementation (like kame) has no enabling command because ipsecSetSAD.rmt
and ipsecSetSPD.rmt can do both configuring and enabling IPsec function.
So there are no command execution in this script for such implementations.
