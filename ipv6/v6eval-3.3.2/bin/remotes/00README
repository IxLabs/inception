In this release (1.1), remote control files (*.rmt) are separated each
target.  

Target specific *.rmt files are stored in sub-directories.
  Ex.: kame-freebsd, linux-v6, ms-win2k, sun-solaris etc..

Each directory name is same as 'System' in nut.def file.

When 'Sysytem' defined as 'manual', all remote control methods display
prompt and wait manual operation.

If sub-directory name 'System' is not found, remote control methods use
v6eval/bin/unknown/*.rmt as unknown 'System',  these *.rmt files do nothing.
